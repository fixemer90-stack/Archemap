# V2-E3 S02: Build chart adapter

## Status

✅ Реализовано

## Context

This story belongs to `V2-E3 — Natal chart adapter`.

Implement `chart_adapter.py` that produces `NatalChartV2` from engine output.

Related architecture:

- `docs/ROADMAP-v2.md`
- `docs/architecture/astrotype-v2-natal-report-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/astrotype-v2-database-design.md`
- `docs/architecture/astrotype-v2-c4-architecture.md`
- `docs/architecture/astrotype-v2-cloud-core-mobile-desktop-strategy.md`
- `docs/SRS/SRS-E16-astrotype-v2-cloud-core.md`


## What to do

1. Read the related architecture and roadmap documents.
2. Inspect existing code/docs relevant to this boundary before implementation.
3. Implement only the scope of this story.
4. Add or update tests/documentation for the changed contract.
5. Verify with targeted commands and record the evidence in this story when work starts.

## Files likely affected

| Path | Action |
|---|---|
| `backend/app/modules/astrotype_v2/` | Add/update v2 backend module code when implementation starts. |
| `docs/features/E16-v2-e3-natal-chart-adapter/` | Keep feature/story docs synchronized. |
| `docs/SRS/SRS-E16-astrotype-v2-cloud-core.md` | Update if functional/API/data contract changes. |

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Scope is implemented without crossing into unrelated v2 epics.
- [x] v2 remains natal-only and does not depend on socionics/Model A/function strengths.
- [x] `chart_adapter.py` converts chart-engine output into v2 ORM rows without persisting them.
- [x] Mars/Taurus/10/retrograde style placement data maps to structured v2 rows.
- [x] Aspects are stored with canonical body order, orb, angle and deterministic strength.
- [x] Balances and emphasis patterns are derived without legacy typology fields.
- [x] Behavior is backed by tests or documented verification evidence.
- [x] Relevant parent `FEATURE.md` row is updated when the story status changes.
