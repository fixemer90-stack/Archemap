## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Scope is implemented without crossing into unrelated v2 epics.
- [x] v2 remains natal-only and does not depend on socionics/Model A/function strengths.
- [x] Behavior is backed by tests or documented verification evidence.
- [x] Relevant parent `FEATURE.md` row is updated when the story status changes.

## Verification commands

```bash
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/unit/test_astrotype_v2/test_outline.py::test_score_theme_clusters_groups_themes_by_primary_section_with_stable_scores -v --tb=short
